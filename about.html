                Hi, I'm Davann. Welcome to my portfolio!
            </h2>
            <h3 class="texts">
                Was born in Cambodia and lived in a small city near capital city, I always felt that one day I would
                move abroad and challenge myself living in different environment. Then in 2015, I decided to move to
                Finland leaving many things to follow my long-life dream. I started with studying in a univesity of
                applied sciences and graduated with bachelor degree in Management Assitants, which has defined my
                dreamed career as a professional digital marketer. I am very motivated in achieving this goal and keep
                developing my knowledge in this area by doing it. Therefore, I have been collecting experiences from
                internship, work trial and self-searched online courses. You can find more about my education and work
                experiences in the followings lists. Hope you enjoy my portfolio and feel free to contact me for any
                collaborations.
