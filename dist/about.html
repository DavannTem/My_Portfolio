                Was born in Cambodia and lived in a small city near capital city, I always felt that one day I would move abroad and challenge myself living in different environment. Then in 2015, I decided to move to Finland leaving many things to follow my long-life dream. I started with studying in a univesity of applied sciences and graduated with bachelor degree in Management Assitants, which has defined my dreamed career as a professional digital marketer. I am very motivated in achieving this goal and keep developing my knowledge in this area by doing it. Therefore, I have been collecting the experiences from internship, work trial and self-searched online courses. You can find more about my education and work experiences in the followings lists. Hope you enjoy my portfolio and feel free to contact me for any projects or even to get to know me more!
